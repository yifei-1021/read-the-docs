Welcome to BANKSY\_py's documentation (test)!
===================================

**BANKSY** is a method for clustering spatial transcriptomic data by augmenting the transcriptomic profile of each cell with an average of the transcriptomes of its spatial neighbors. **BANKSY** is a scalable clustering method for both cell-typing and domain segmentation. 

This documentation provides examples for using the python version of BANKSY, which is hosted at `Banksy_py <https://github.com/prabhakarlab/Banksy_py/tree/main>`_. 
Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   We are still actively developing the python version of banksy `Banksy_py <https://github.com/prabhakarlab/Banksy_py/tree/main>`_.. For the ``R`` library, refer to `Banksy <https://github.com/prabhakarlab/Banksy>`_.
